# Aim
Using different Machine Learning algorithms to predict characteristics during the vacuum drying of fruits and vegetables

# Scope of the project
Drying is one of the most important food processing methods to improve the post-harvest
shelf life which could greatly reduce the global food waste. Pulsed vacuum drying,
alternative food drying strategy, has been proven by researches to be highly energy efficient,
particularly when comparing to continuous vacuum drying of food products and is
particularly suitable for drying of heat sensitive fruits and vegetables. Predicting drying
characteristics using data driven methods are proven to be useful in developing sustainable
and energy efficient drying methods. In addition to this, it could also help in real-time
monitoring and control of drying processes which could result in better quality dried
products.Using machine learning (ML) for predicting drying characteristics has been a
bustling field of research in recent years as it could help developing more sustainable and
energy efficient drying methods that would be a boon for businesses operating in the food
industry. With that in mind, this work has been designed with an aim to use three different
machine learning algorithms, namely linear regression (LR), artificial neural networks
(ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) to predict the drying kinetics. The prediction
of important drying kinetics, which is in this case, the moisture ratio, is performed by
training the machine learning algorithms using the data obtained from experiments. Using
this historical data, the models has been optimised using various techniques to improve their
prediction accuracy.
